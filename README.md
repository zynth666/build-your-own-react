# Build Your Own React

A hands-on project to learn the fundamentals of building a React-like library from scratch. This repository guides you through implementing a simplified version of React, covering concepts such as virtual DOM, reconciliation, and hooks. I am also using typescript as an extra to the guide that I am following.

## Features

- Virtual DOM implementation
- Reconciliation algorithm
- Function components
- Hooks
- ...and more

## Learning Resources
